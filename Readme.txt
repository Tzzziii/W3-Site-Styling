This site is just a showcase of a poem I wrote when I was in high school for an assignment. The background image is an image of me and my cousins with my grandfather before he passed. The red arrow indicates me.
There is a slight issue around lines 15-19 where I wanted to enclose the page title in the same sepia box that the poem is enclosed in, but I kept running into formatting issues. In the code, it is still technically
enclosed in the box but when you actuallly open the page from my view it isn't. Without the formatting correction in the .css lines 2-5, the header will appear at the bottom of the page on the left of the poem and
fthe formatting for the poem also gets skewed. I tried really hard to fix it, but if I fixed one I lost the other so I decided to just keep it there even if the header is missing the sepia box. I was not able to find
a solution to that.
