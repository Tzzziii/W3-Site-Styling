    <!--In these lines from 12-16, I wanted to include the header in the same sepia box that the rest of the poem is in, but in doing so it rearranged the header to
        be on the bottom left of the page. I had to use the lines 2-5 in my CSS file  to put the title back at the cost of no longer having the border. I wasn't able
        to figure out how to get them both (where I wanted it to be and the opaque box)-->

        When did you stop loving us?<br>
        When did the darts<br>
        Propelled to inject us with amnesia<br>
        About the beauty of dark skin<br>
        Infect you?<br>
        When did you forget it was black knees<br>
        Between which your scalp was soothed<br>
        And your secret tears collected<br>
        When the others tried to trample you<br>
        Like mire beneath their feet<br>
        And it got you?
        <br>
        <!-- In line 42, I used &apos; to indicate that there needs to be an apostrophe there that is apart of the text and not apart of the code. These are called HTML entities.-->
        Don&apos;t you remember that<br>
        You were at home<br>
        In the safety of the shadow of our bosom?<br>
        Do you recall how we fought alongside you<br>
        Not against you<br>
        And cleaned your battle scars with<br>
        Bay rum and molasses.<br>
        And when it was hardest to breathe love<br>
        Because they polluted our atmosphere with hate<br>
        We loved you with all the strength<br>
        We are all forced to have to survive.<br>
        <br>
        But they made your eyes blurry.<br>
        You can&apos;t see our beauty.<br>
        They made you despise yourself so deep<br>
        You cover your mirrors<br>
        And any likeness of the true you<br>
        Must be kept at arm&apos;s length.<br>
        <br>
        When?<br>
        When did you stop loving us?<br>
        When did your soul imbibe<br>
        The words of our enemies<br>
        Making you spit them back at us<br>
        Like poisoned darts?<br>
        When?<br>
        When black men?<br>
        When did you stop loving us?<br>
    </p>
